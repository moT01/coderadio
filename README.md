To use:

- Clone the repo
- `npm install` in the root folder
- `npm start` in the root folder

That will build and watch for changes to the component

To see/test the component in the example project...

- change into the `example` directory and run `npm install`
- `npm start` in the `example` directory

If it went smooth, you should be able to make changes to the main component and it will update the example project.
